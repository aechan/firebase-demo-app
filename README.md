# firebase-demo-app

The purpose of this demo is to show how integrating Firebase into an app or website instantly enhances the functionality of your app without having to set up a backend.

This demonstrates:

1. Simple user auth with firebase auth.
2. Easy NoSQL database with Firestore.

## Setup

This demo is an Ionic 4 app. Ionic is a hybrid app platform which allows you to write apps in Typescript, HTML, SCSS, and Angular just like you would a regular web app and then Ionic builds a "native" mobile app for iOS and Android from that codebase as well as allowing you to publish the app for the browser. This is a good platform to demo Firebase on because it shows how Firebase can be used for mobile apps and websites and Firebase integrates really well with Typescript/Angular.

To set up the demo:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/aechan/firebase-demo-app`
2. CD to the downloaded code: `cd ./firebase-demo-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Install Ionic `npm i -g ionic`
5. Serve the demo app to your browser (might have to close and reopen your shell/terminal after installing ionic for this to work): `ionic serve` - will automatically open your default browser after transpilation.
